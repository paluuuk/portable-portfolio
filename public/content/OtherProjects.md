## Multi-Class Land Cover Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Satellite Images
I created a Keras CNN to classify satellite images (4 land cover types) using a 28 x 28 x 4 input format. Preprocessing encompassed reshaping, normalization, and one-hot encoding. The model attained 97% accuracy on a 10-epoch validation run, featuring dropout for improved generalization.

## Libera, Peer to Peer Drone Delivery
Developed a 3D printed autonomous quadcopter drone. The drone was designed for "on-call" deliveries, featuring an attached payload box. I created a docking station concept that enabled seamless battery swaps for the drones via spring-loaded contacts. The drone was assembled powered by ArduPilot. To ensure precision I callibrated the drone  using the QGroundControl software.

## Sentiment Analysis and Recommendation System
Deployed tools such as Pandas, linear regression, Random Forest Regression, Adaboost classifier and k-means to analyse the datasets and visualised the data using time series, correlation matrices and top n-grams. Performed sentiment analysis using NLTK using lexicon based approaches - TextBlob and VaderSentiment and developed a recommendation algorithm using TF-IDF vectorizer.

## REXUS Lunar Rover
Devised a double lambda, rocker bogie mechanism paired with bio-mimicked wheels along with modified suspension and differential systems for a lunar rover using Ackerman's principle and spatial dynamics. We paired the rover with a modular robotic arm for multi-purpose and multi-mission use that can be individually configured for any mission at hand and take up n-DoF using n modules.

## International Asteroid Search Collaboration
Led a student team to analyze data sets obtained from 1.8-m Pan-STARRS telescope using Astrometrica software to find true signatures of Main Belt Asteroids for a campaign conducted by NASA and International Astronomical Search Collaboration. Performed operations on image sets such as image reduction, known objects overlay, comparing dRA and dDec values, and checking for constant magnitude trajectory to achieve preliminary discoveries.

## ARTEMIS MSB-1 Rover
Developed a rover with spherical exo-structure, incorporating a modular approach to contain the various end effectors and sensor modules. These modules can be divided into mission-equipment and critical-equipment; miss-equipment module contains equipment specifically demanded by the mission parameters, whereas critical-equipment modules contain equipment that will be needed by the rover for continual mission operability.
