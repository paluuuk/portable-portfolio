## Environmental Features Recognition for Predictive Prosthesis Control
Currently, I am actively engaged in the development of an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, along with a tailored training approach for classifying environmental characteristics using data captured from depth cameras. This classification accuracy holds great potential for enhancing the prediction accuracy of locomotion modes vital for prosthesis control. Additionally, I am in the process of implementing algorithms that exhibit precise capabilities in estimating incline, stair dimensions, and other vital environmental parameters using stabilized 3D point clouds. The project also involves the formulation of inventive techniques, such as the integration of RANSAC line detection, to robustly deduce terrain features from occasionally noisy 2D slices extracted from point cloud data. As the project advances, the goal is to further refine these methodologies and achieve even more accurate results.

## Sensync Mobile Application
We developed a cross-platform app catering to individuals with ASD and their caregivers. Our work involved utilizing Flutter SDK and Firebase to create a solution that enhances connectivity and support. Leveraging the WESAD Dataset, we constructed a stress detection machine learning model using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. This model predicts sensory overload by analyzing data from wearable devices like heart rate, electrodermal activity, and body temperature. The deployment occurred on Google Cloud Platform to ensure accessibility. To enhance user experience, we implemented a local notification service that alerts caregivers about high-stress levels and the patient's location. Additionally, we enabled automatic playback of curated soothing audio-visuals on the patient's app interface. We also designed features for meditation and mood logging, displaying insightful visualizations on the caregiver's interface.

## Nanyang Venture Electric Car
Worked on a groundbreaking project encompassing the design, prototyping, and manufacture of a single-seater Formula electrical car. This innovative vehicle featured a lightweight carbon fiber reinforced composite bodyshell and chassis, coupled with a polycarbonate exterior, all powered by a 24V lithium-ion battery. My responsibilities extended to designing the complete circuit schematic, power transmission system, and wire harnessing, in addition to integrating the electrical hardware seamlessly. I successfully programmed a real-time data interface for various subsystems, including CANBUS, motor controller, BMS, and GPS, aiming to minimize energy consumption per kilometer traveled. The car underwent rigorous testing, achieving a remarkable top speed of 80 km/h, showcasing exceptional handling across diverse scenarios. Moreover, I engineered regenerative braking for optimized performance during curves and implemented a fail-safe steering system to ensure safe vehicle coasting. This project was part of both Shell Eco Marathon and Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers), and garnered recognition by being interviewed by CNA News.
